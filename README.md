# Synthetic - Create synthetic sounds with go

The guitar package is inspired from the [timiskhakov
music](https://github.com/timiskhakov/music) project, with an improvment
that consists in calculating the whole set of frequencies from the La3
reference instead of tabulate all the possible frequencies of all
couples (string number, fret number).
